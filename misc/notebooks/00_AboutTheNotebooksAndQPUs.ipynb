This software is a freeware Python package which comes with interoperability connectors. With this tool only two basic simulators are available to the user: **CLinAlg** and **PyLinAlg**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Qaptiva 800 series**: is the Quantum Appliance Toolset developed by Eviden. This software product extends the capabilities of myQLM, adding more functionalities, more emulators and the ability to execute on real quantum hardware. In the case of the emulators, it expands the maximum number of simulated qubits beyond 25. This *Toolset* was designed to be executed in the **EVIDEN Quantum Learning Machine** (https://atos.net/en/solutions/quantum-learning-machine). In CESGA facilities, for example, the **QLM30** is available. This machine guarantees the possibility of simulating circuits up to 30 qubits, but in some cases, it can simulate larger cases. Also, it includes other advanced simulators a linear-algebra-based quantum emulator **LinAlg** or a Matrix Product State **MPS** one. Additionally, this software comes with many extra functionalities like circuit rewriting and optimization tools and the possibility for configuring and simulating noisy Quantum Processing Units using the **Noisy Quantum Emulator** (**NoisyQProc** object).\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools have the same semantics to create quantum circuits, so the user can write a quantum program using **myQLM** and optimize, rewrite and execute the circuit using the **Qaptiva 800 series**. Additionally, a third tool called **Qaptiva Access** allows the user to submit **myQLM** heavy computation to a remote **Qaptiva** machine (like the one installed in CESGA facilities)\n"
